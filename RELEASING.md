# Releasing kekkai

Family versioning, tagging, and release policy:
[tenkai ADR 0040](https://github.com/Sannrox/tenkai/blob/main/docs/decisions/0040-family-versioning-and-release-policy.md).

This page is kekkai-local: how a maintainer prepares and tags **this**
repository.

## Who cuts a tag

Agents never push `v*` tags. After the version-bump pull request merges, the
maintainer creates an annotated, signed `vX.Y.Z` tag with the registered
release-signing key. The tag must equal the workspace version. The workflow
refuses unsigned or lightweight tags.

## Prepare

1. Choose the target version. Do not invent one in a feature pull request.
2. Draft notes with `scripts/changelog-draft.sh`. Pull requests never edit
   `CHANGELOG.md`; the release step writes the section from merged work.
3. Land the version-bump pull request. Workspace crates move in lockstep.

## Tag

Create an annotated, signed tag on the merged release commit on `main`:

```text
vX.Y.Z
```

A tag is never moved, deleted, or reused. The tagged commit must be on
`main`; the workflow refuses any other commit, so there are no hotfix tags on
`release/vX.Y` branches.

## Release candidates

Cut `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` (or `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`) before the final tag:

1. Land a version-bump pull request that sets the workspace version to
   `X.Y.Z-rc.N` and adds a `## [X.Y.Z-rc.N]` section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
   The final `vX.Y.Z` needs its own section; it never reuses the rc notes.
2. Tag `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` on that commit.
3. The release publishes as a GitHub pre-release and is never marked latest.

A failed release candidate costs only an rc number. A final tag on a commit
whose workspace version is still `X.Y.Z-rc.N` is refused.

## Start, retry, and dry-run

A `v*` tag push runs `.github/workflows/release-dispatch.yml`. It only runs
`gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f tag=<tag>`, so the release always
runs **main's** `release.yml`, never the copy at the tagged commit.

`release.yml` refuses a tagged run that does not start from `main`. It then:

- checks out the tag and fetches the annotated tag object;
- verifies the signed tag with main's `scripts/verify-release-tag.sh` and
  main's allowed keys against the tagged commit's `Cargo.toml`;
- requires the tagged commit to be on `main`;
- validates, tests, builds and packages that commit, writes an SBOM, attests
  provenance, and records that commit as the manifest `git_sha`;
- drafts the GitHub Release with `gh release create <tag> --verify-tag` from
  the matching CHANGELOG section, attaches the binaries and the signed family
  release manifest (component, version, git SHA, binary digests, attestation
  URLs, gate flags), and publishes it last.

kekkai does not publish a container image, so there is no `latest` tag.

To retry a failed release, fix the workflow on `main` and run it again for the
same tag:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f tag=vX.Y.Z
```

A retry picks up fixes to `release.yml` and to the tag verifier and keys.
Everything else (the release scripts, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the sources) comes
from the tagged commit, so a bug there needs a new rc or patch version.

A re-run resumes the draft release. It refuses a release that is already
published, both before it builds and before it publishes; cut a new version
instead. One run per tag executes at a time.

Pull requests and `workflow_dispatch` without a tag dry-run the same
packaging path on that ref. Dry runs never mint attestations or touch a
GitHub Release.

## Provenance

Attestations record the workflow that built the artifacts, which is main's
`release.yml` at `refs/heads/main`, not the tag. The source is pinned by the
signed tag and by the manifest `git_sha`, which is the tagged commit.

Allowed tag-signing keys live in `security/release-tag-fingerprints` with the
public key in `security/release-tag-key.asc`. A tagged run uses the copies on
`main`.
